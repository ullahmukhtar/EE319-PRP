    "The frequentist probability suffers from the following problems. \n",
    "- It cannot be applied to (events of) non-repeatable experiments\n",
    "- convergence of the long-run relative frequency can be proved in restricted application domains\n",
    "  - Not all probabilistic experiments are random\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other intepretations of probability\n",
    "- Subjective probability (degree of belief)\n",
    "  - Put your money where your mouth is\n",
    "- Logical probability (plausibilty, strength of evidence)\n",
    "  - Rational individuals with same evidence should assign the same probability to an event\n",

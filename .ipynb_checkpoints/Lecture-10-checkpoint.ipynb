    "- A dog trainer wants to buy $8$ dogs all of which are either cocker spaniels, Irish setters, or Russian wolfhounds. In how many ways can she make the choice?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Viewed as a placement problem, the \"$8$ dogs\" are our \"indistinguishable objects\", each denoted by $\\mathsf{d}$, to be placed without exclusion in three different cells labelled 1 (cocker spaniels), 2 (Irish setters) and 3 (Russian wolfhounds). The different placements can be depicted by strings of $8\\ \\mathsf{d}$'s with two partitioing bars placed at different positions. In other words, each different placement requires to choose two different positions for the bars from the available 8+(3-1) positions. That amounts to $\\binom{8+3-1}{3-1}$ different ways to buy the dogs.\n",

The new types of seating arrangments is unrestricted in the sense that two people may sit next to one another. The number of seating arrangements then equals $\\binom{16+5-1}{5-1}$.\n",

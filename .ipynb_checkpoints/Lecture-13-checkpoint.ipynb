    ">The base sample space $\\mathsf{\\Omega}$ has size $50$. The base space can be partitioned into two events: $\\mathsf{D}$ for defective items and $\\mathsf{D^c}$ for nondefective items. The sequential experiment involves an unordered selection without replacement. ‘Unordered’ because only the number of defective items is of interest. ‘Without replacement’ because it makes no sense to test an item that has already been tested. The sequential experiment has size $\\binom{50}{10}$ for the number of ways $10$ items can be selected from $\\mathsf{\\Omega}$. The event of our interest has size $\\binom{10}{5}\\binom{40}{5}$ for the number of ways $5$ defective items can be selected from $\\mathsf{D}$ and $5$ nondefective items from $\\mathsf{D^c}$.

Urn $0$ contains a ball with the number $1$ and two balls with the number $0$, and urn $1$ contains five balls with the number $1$ and one ball with the number $0$. The urn from which the first draw is made is selected at random by flipping a fair coin. Urn $0$ is used if the outcome is heads and urn $1$ if the outcome is tails. Thereafter the urn used in a subexperiment corresponds to the number on the ball selected in the previous subexperiment.\n",

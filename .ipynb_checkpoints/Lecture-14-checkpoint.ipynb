    "### Borel sets generated by right-closed intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lecture, we established that Borel sets include all subsets of the real line encountered in practice. Borel sets are elements of the Borel field, an event space generated by right-closed intervals $\\mathsf{B}_{x}=\\left(-\\infty,x\\right]$. Consequently, all we need is assign probabilities to the intervals $\\mathsf{B}_{x}$ provided our sample space is the real line. Probabilities of all the other Borel sets can then be determined by application of Kolmogorv axioms and its corollaries. This suggests the following strategy for solving any probabiliy problem.\n",

    "It is very important to note that, despite the numerical equality of the final probability, the probability measure $P$ and the CDF $F$ are different functions. The former is a set function (defined on the Borel field over real line) whereas the latter is a point function (defined on the real line itself).\n",

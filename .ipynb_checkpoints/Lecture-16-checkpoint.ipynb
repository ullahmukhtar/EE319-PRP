    "The Lebesgue measure, denoted $\\mu^{\\wedge}$, generalizes the concept of length of an interval in 1-D, area of a rectangle in 2-D, volume of a cuboid in 3-D, and so on to a measure of any set. The Lebesgue measure is useful for uncountable sets but not so for countable sets as it assigns zero value to singletons. To deal with countable sets, the so-called counting measure, denoted $\\mu^{\\#}$, that generalizes the concept of cardinality for countable sets. \n",

Towards that end, we will employ the concept of a function, or a mapping. Before we get on that road, let us refresh a few concepts of functions.\n",

    "Given a probability space $\\left(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P\\right)$ as a model of an experiment, we need a function $X\\colon\\mathsf{\\Omega}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ that assigns a real number  $X(\\omega)$ to every point $\\omega$ of the outcome space in a way that preserves the event structure of the event space $\\mathcal{F}$ so that a new probability space $\\left(\\mathbb{R},\\mathfrak{B}\\left(\\mathbb{R}\\right),P_{X}\\right)$ can be conveniently used to assign probabilities. The event structure of $\\mathcal{F}$ can be preserved only if the inverse $X^{-1}\\left[\\mathsf{B}\\right]$ of every Borel set $B\\in\\mathfrak{B}\\left(\\mathbb{R}\\right)$ is contained in $\\mathcal{F}$.

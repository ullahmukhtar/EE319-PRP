    "# The Monty Hall Problem\n",
    "This problem comes from a popular U.S. television show called “Let’s Make a Deal.” The show host, Monty Hall, would hide a car behind one of three doors and a goat behind each of the other two doors. The contestant is invited to choose one of the doors. Monty Hall opens one of the remaining two doors so as to reveal a goat. He then gives the contestant the option to either stay with his original choice or to switch to the remaining unopened door. Is it in the interest of the contestant to switch?"

    "## Naive Approach\n",
    "It is tempting to suppose, because Monty Hall always opens a door with a goat behind, that no information has been conveyed. Thus the contestant will be left with two equally likely doors and a probability 1/2 of winning regardless of whether (s)he switches or not. This line of reasoning, while appealing, is wrong."

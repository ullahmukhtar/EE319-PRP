For reasons that will become obvious soon, an even better choice is to reserve the interval $\\mathcal{X}=\\left[0,1\\right]$ and map the segments, in order, to the intervals $\\left(0,1/n\\right],\\left(1/n,2/n\\right],\\ldots,\\left(\\left(n-1\\right)/n,1\\right]$ among which the total probability is distributed uniformly so that each subset has probability $1/n$. The remaining subset $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathcal{X}$ is assigned probability $0$. The CDF $F\\left(x\\right)$ assumes a value of zero in the open interval $\\left(-\\infty,0\\right)$, rises gradually from $0$ to $1/n$ in $\\left(0,1/n\\right]$, from $1/n$ to $2/n$ in $\\left(1/n,2/n\\right]$, all the way up to a rise from $\\left(n-1\\right)/n$ to $1$ in $\\left(\\left(n-1\\right)/n,1\\right]$ and remains at that value in $\\left(1,\\infty\\right)$.

Towards that end, we will employ the concept of a function, or a mapping. Before we get on that road, let us refresh a few concepts of functions.\n",

    "Given a probability space $\\left(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P\\right)$ as a model of an experiment, we need a function $X\\colon\\mathsf{\\Omega}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ that assigns a real number  $X(\\omega)$ to every point $\\omega$ of the outcome space in a way that preserves the event structure of the event space $\\mathcal{F}$ so that a new probability space $\\left(\\mathbb{R},\\mathfrak{B}\\left(\\mathbb{R}\\right),P_{X}\\right)$ can be conveniently used to assign probabilities.

Note that the validity of a function as a RV is determined entirely by the event space $\\mathcal{F}$. Neither the values assigned by the RV nor the probability measure $P$ has any role to play as far as the validity of a function to qualify as a RV is concerned. However, a RV is useful only if it assigns values that reflect our quantity of interest.

    "The Lebesgue measure, denoted $\\mu^{\\wedge}$, generalizes the concept of length of an interval in 1-D, area of a rectangle in 2-D, volume of a cuboid in 3-D, and so on to a measure of any set. The Lebesgue measure is useful for uncountable sets but not so for countable sets as it assigns zero value to singletons. To deal with countable sets, the so-called counting measure, denoted $\\mu^{\\#}$, that generalizes the concept of cardinality for countable sets. \n",

    "We need to focus on the second point: a way to represent events of interest (in the original event space) to Borel sets (in the event space over the real line). Towards that end, we will employ the concept of a function, or a mapping. Before we get on that road, let us refresh a few concepts of functions.\n",

    "Given a probability space $\\left(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P\\right)$ as a model of an experiment, we need a function $X\\colon\\mathsf{\\Omega}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ that assigns a real number  $X(\\omega)$ to every point $\\omega$ of the outcome space in a way that preserves the event structure of the event space $\\mathcal{F}$ so that a new probability space $\\left(\\mathbb{R},\\mathfrak{B}\\left(\\mathbb{R}\\right),P_{X}\\right)$ can be conveniently used to assign probabilities. The event structure of $\\mathcal{F}$ can be preserved only if the inverse $X^{-1}\\left[\\mathsf{B}\\right]$ of every Borel set $B\\in\\mathfrak{B}\\left(\\mathbb{R}\\right)$ is contained in $\\mathcal{F}$.

Note that the validity of a function as a RV is determined entirely by the event space $\\mathcal{F}$. Neither the values assigned by the RV nor the probability measure $P$ has any role to play as far the validity of a RV is concerned. However, a RV is useful only if it assigns values that reflect our quantity of interest.

    "### The Monty Hall Problem\n",
    "This problem comes from a popular U.S. television show called “Let’s Make a Deal”. The show host, Monty Hall, would hide a car behind one of three doors and a goat behind each of the other two doors. The contestant is invited to choose one of the doors. Monty Hall opens one of the remaining two doors so as to reveal a goat. He then gives the contestant the option to either stay with his original choice or to switch to the remaining unopened door. Is it in the interest of the contestant to switch?"

    "## Naive Approach\n",
    "It is tempting to suppose, because Monty Hall always opens a door with a goat behind, that no information has been conveyed. Thus the contestant will be left with two equally likely doors and a probability 1/2 of winning regardless of whether (s)he switches or not. This line of reasoning, while appealing, is wrong."

    "## An Elementary Approach\n",
    "Both the above approaches avoid explicit enumeration of the underlying outcome space thanks to probability methods derived from conditional probability. A more elementary approach using the detailed outcome space is possible and is developed here. This detailed approach (to solve the Monty Hall problem) is unfortunately not covered in standard texts. This approach starts with enumeration of sample spaces for the two strategies (referred to above as the \"stay strategy\" and \"switch strategy\"). A typical outcome of each experiment is of the form $x_1 x_2 x_3$ where $x_i$ is the object behind the relevant door at stage $i$. Stage 1 corresponds to the initial pick by the contestant, stage 2 to the door opened by Monty Hall and stage 3 to the final choice of the contestant.  The object $x_i$ is replaced with $\\mathrm{C}$ for a car, $\\mathrm{G_1}$ for the first goat, and $\\mathrm{G_2}$ for the second goat. The 3-stage experiment can be viewed as a combined experiment with three component experiments, one at each stage. Denote by $P_i$ the probability measure of the component experiment at stage $i$. Write $P_{12}$ for the probability measure of the combined experiment of stages $1$ and $2$. To keep the notation consistent, write $P_{123}$ for the probability measure of the combined experiment of all three stages. Write $P_{j\\mid i}$ for the probability measure of the experiment of stage $j$ conditioned on (events of) experiment of stage $i$. Finally, write $P_{k\\mid ij}$ for the probability measure of the experiment of stage $k$ conditioned on (events of) the combined experiment of stages $i$-$j$\n",
